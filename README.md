# Arch Linux User Repository Packages

This repository contains the source files (PKGBUILDs and *.install scripts) for
the packages that I maintain in the Arch User Repository.

## [python-pint-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-pint-git) and [python2-pint-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python2-pint-git)

Pint is Python package to define, operate and manipulate physical quantities:
the product of a numerical value and a unit of measurement. It allows arithmetic
operations between them and conversions from and to different
units. (Description copied from the project website
[here](http://pint.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)).

## [thinkpad-scripts](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/thinkpad-scripts)

A set of scripts for the ThinkPad X220 Tablet for docking, screen rotation,
fixing scancode-to-keycode mappings, enabling/disabling the touch screen, etc.
The project website is [here](http://martin-ueding.de/en/projects/think-rotate).

## [think-rotate](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/think-rotate)

The old name for `thinkpad-scripts`.
